# Welcome to My Project Docs

## About
I started working on these pages to practice documentation and go over some of my past projects. I’ve been using my older code a lot for new projects and without proper documentation, it’s easy to forget how things work. I already ran into an issue where I forgot how to run one of my own projects. If I had it documented, it wouldn’t have been a problem.

- Pages aren't all developed yet. I am documenting these pages on my own time. There
will be some content missing at the moment. 

## Projects
Some of the projects I’ve been working on:

- [Furry Google Calendar AI](./projects/GoogleCalendarAi.md) 

- [Furry Events Calendar](./projects/JewelryExchangeSurvey.md)
